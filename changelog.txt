-Fr0st can now save flame files, including batches for creating animations.

-large increase in rendering speed.

-Support for variations added.

-In the source version, any script can be run hassle free just by double clicking on it. To achieve this, the script must include "from runscript import *" at the top. Otherwise, the script to be run needs to be specified as a command line argument to fr0st.exe.

-fixed various bugs, including one which crashed the program on the ocurrence of very large coordinate values.

-When assigning to values the y axis is no longer inverted. Fr0st is still 100% compatible with .flame files

-Scripting mechanism was significantly simplified, it's now much closer to Apophysis.

-Fr0st can now be run without initializing the screen, useful for file generating scripts.

-About 50% improvement in rendering speed. Among other optimizations coloring is now handled differently, so each pixel maxes out at its fully saturated color, not white. The stylistic implications of this are subjective, so the faster method was kept.

-fixed several bugs related to rounding errors.

-abstracted away a lot of implementation details, to make scripting easier. This is still a work in progress, nothing is set in stone yet.

-fleshed out documentation for scripting.

-released several new scripts:
    -various scripts which create procedural animations
    -the renderer, which outputs high quality frames (see the sample animation included with the release)
