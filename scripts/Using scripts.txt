
Loading scripts
===============

To change the behaviour of fr0st, you can use any of the example scripts provided in this folder or create one of your own. To run a script, just run the fr0st program from a command line and pass in the script name as an argument. The scripts folder is automatically included in the path.

Source release only:  if your script begins with "from runscript import*", you can run it directly as a python file.


If no script is passed in as an argument, default.py is loaded instead.



Writing your own script
=======================

The script files are Python source code. Each script defines a series of actions to be taken by the program. The easiest way to learn is to look at the included examples.



How is a flame loaded?
======================

By default, the loaded file is sample.flame. A flame object consists of:


-All the transforms. Each transform can be accessed by its index and has several attributes and methods (see below for details).

-The gradient, containing 256 (R,G,B) color tuples.

-The flame header data, such as size, camera and image settings.


Useful Commands
===============


Here is an list explaining all attributes of display and flame that can be modified by the script:



display.size

Define the size of the screen. You can also set display.width and display.height separately. This comand will cause strange behaviour if the video system is already initialized, so you should never modify if you already called display.render().
Default is 640,480



display.quality

Set the number of points calculated per frame. This is not equivalent to Apophysis quality. A higher number means a more dense and precise fractal. When Increasing this value you will generally want to increase the background alpha as well (see below).
Default quality is 9000.



flame = load_flame("sample.flame","flame_name")

Loads a different flame than the default. The flame file must be located in the parameters subfolder. When flame_name is not specified, the first flame in the file is loaded.
Default is "sample.flame".


display.background_alpha

sets the speed at which drawn pixels fade. Value goes from 0 (pixels are never erased) to 255 (completely black screen every frame).
Default value is 8.



flame.xform

A list of the flame's transforms. You can write to the coefficients or triangle coordinates of each transform directly, or invoke any of its methods to set the triangle coordinates.

Each transform contains the following values: a, b, c, d, e, f, color, weight, chaos and any variations. If you want to change one of these values, you just need to find it within the correct transform.

For example, if you want to change the "a" coef of the first transform to 0.5, you would do it like this:

flame.xform[0].a = 0.5

You can also change the triangle coordinates directly:

flame.xform[0].x = 0.3,0.5

There are also several methods avaliable which make moving, scaling and rotating triangles easier. The methods are: move, move_x, move_y, move_o, rotate, orbit and scale

If you want to move the "O" point of your second triangle by some amount, you'd write:

flame.xform[1].move_o(1,1)

or, if you want to move the whole triangle and not just the origin point:

flame.xform[1].move_position(1,1)

Always keep in mind that indices start from 0, so the second triangle above is correctly called with the index "1".
